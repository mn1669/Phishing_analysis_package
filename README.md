# Phishing Email Analysis â€” Task 
Author: <M.Soma Niranjan>

This repo contains an analysis of the email: "Youâ€™re Shortlisted â€“ Cyber Security Internship First Selection Round ðŸš€" (source `.eml` included).

## Files
- sample-email.eml           -- original email file (raw .eml).
- analysis_report.md         -- the analysis report (this file).
- evidence/                  -- screenshots, raw headers, WHOIS outputs, VirusTotal screenshots (if used).

## How I analysed
1. Viewed raw headers (opened the `.eml` source).  
2. Reviewed `Authentication-Results` for DKIM/SPF/DMARC.  
3. Inspected the `Received` chain to identify originating host and IP.  
4. Hovered/expanded tracked links to reveal redirect targets (do not click before verifying).  
5. Recommended independent verification via the organisation's official website or contact details.

## Quick notes
- Authentication checks in this email passed (dkim/spf/dmarc), indicating the email was sent through the domain's configured mailing provider.
- Still recommended: do not enter credentials on any page opened from tracking links until you confirm the landing host is trustworthy.
